Comparison of the different DMRs between the respective experiments and the base experiment. On the x-axis are the experiments, on the y-axis are the different gene regions (found by `Chipseeker <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ChIPseeker/inst/doc/ChIPseeker.html>`_). If there are several DMRs within an experiment in a gene region, the maximum was selected; if an experiment has no DMRs in a gene region, the value was set to 0.
